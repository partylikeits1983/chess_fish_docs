## Wager Contract

The Wager contract handles the main logic of handling the payouts of the players for 1v1 games. The wager contract keeps track of how many wins and losses are in a series of games between two players.

The wager contract also checks if each player has sufficient time to continue playing the game. 

> Currently, the time limit for a chess wager is the entire time limit for all games in the wager. 

Suppose you are playing wager with 5 games with a time limit of 5 hours. The time limit of 5 hours per player is for all games, not per game. 
> So if you spend 4 hours and 30 minutes on the first game, you have 30 minutes for the remaining 4 games.
