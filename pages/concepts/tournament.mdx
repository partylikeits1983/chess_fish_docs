## Tournaments

Currently, a tournament contract is being developed. Planned features: Players who wish to join a tournament will pay an entrance fee. Most likely the tournament will be in a 'round-robin' style where each player in the tournament plays every other player. The tournament prize will be distributed proportionally to the number of wins to the top 50% of players.
