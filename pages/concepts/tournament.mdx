## Tournaments

Tournaments on Chess.fish are a way to compete against more than one person. Tournaments allow the possibility for players to win significantly more than what they initially deposited to join the tournament. Currently all tournaments on ChessFish are Round Robin tournaments.

|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 3 Players       | 56%       | 37%       | -         | -         | -         | -         | -         |

The figure above shows the varing payout profiles for tournaments of different sizes. The payout profile is designed to maximize the number of winners in a tournament. 

#### Example:

>Let's suppose you join a tournament of 10 players where you are the 10th player. The entry fee for the tournament is 100 USDC.

This means that the total tournament pool is 1000 USDC. 

- The first place winner will receive 36.5% of the pool, which is 365 USDC.
- The second place winner will receive 23% of the pool, which is 230 USDC.
- The third place winner will receive 13.5% of the pool, which is 135 USDC.
- ...and so on for other placements.

Currently, all tournaments have a 7% fee, which is distributed to ChessFish token holders.
