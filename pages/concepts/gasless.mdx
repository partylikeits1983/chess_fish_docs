## Gasless Games

The ChessWager.sol contract has the ability to verify game moves in a gasless manner.

- ChessWager.sol uses ECDSA signatures to ascertain the authenticity of moves without incurring gas fees for the signer.
- The validation ensures that the game moves are signed by the correct player and are in the correct order.
- Invalid moves or signatures lead to transaction reversion. 

### Functions

1. **generateMoveMessage**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `wager`: address indicating the wager associated with the move.
     - `move`: uint16 indicating the player's move.
     - `moveNumber`: uint indicating the sequential order of the move.
     - `expiration`: uint representing the move's expiration timestamp.
   - **Returns**: Encodes the provided details into a byte array.
   - **Visibility**: Public

2. **decodeMoveMessage**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `message`: bytes memory representing the encoded move message.
   - **Returns**: Decoded details of the move (wager, move, moveNumber, expiration).
   - **Visibility**: Internal

3. **getMessageHash**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `wager`: address indicating the wager.
     - `move`: uint16 indicating the move.
     - `moveNumber`: uint indicating the move order.
     - `expiration`: uint indicating the expiration timestamp.
   - **Returns**: A hash derived from the encoded message.
   - **Visibility**: Public

4. **getEthSignedMessageHash**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `_messageHash`: bytes32 representing the hash of a move message.
   - **Returns**: A hash which includes the provided message hash prefixed with the Ethereum signed message format.
   - **Visibility**: Internal

5. **verifyGameView**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `message`: Array of bytes representing encoded move messages.
     - `signature`: Array of bytes representing signatures of the encoded move messages.
   - **Returns**: 
     - `wager`: address of the associated wager.
     - `outcome`: uint8 indicating the game's outcome.
     - `moves`: An array of moves played during the game.
   - **Visibility**: Public

6. **verifyGameUpdateState**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `message`: Array of bytes for encoded move messages.
     - `signature`: Array of bytes for move message signatures.
   - **Returns**: A boolean indicating if the game outcome is non-zero and the state of the wager was successfully updated.
   - **Visibility**: External

7. **validate**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `messageHash`: bytes32 representing the hash of a move message.
     - `signature`: Array of bytes for the move message signatures.
     - `signer`: address of the player who signed the message.
     - `i`: uint index representing the position in the signature array.
   - **Purpose**: Validates that the provided signature corresponds to the hash signed by the player.
   - **Visibility**: Internal
