# Purpose

### *From the ChessFish Whitepaper:*

*“The purpose of ChessFish is to serve as a neutral intermediary between two parties wishing to play chess while betting cryptocurrency on the outcome.”*

### What is the purpose of another chess platform? I mean there's lichess.com, chess.com, and countless others, right?

ChessFish is different. It is a platform where users can play against each other for money. 

It is only at the highest levels can chess players play for money in tournaments.

However even then, top chess organizations such as FIDE have problems associated with centralization.

For example, take Frank. Frank is a chess player who has spent a lot of time playing on lichess and chess.com, however, he is unlikely to become a top 50 world champion at chess. This shouldn't prevent him from being able to make money playing chess.

This is why ChessFish exists. ChessFish allows players to play chess against each other for money with predetermined rules.
