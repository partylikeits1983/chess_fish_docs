# Purpose

### *From the ChessFish Whitepaper:*

*“The purpose of ChessFish is to serve as a neutral intermediary between two or more parties wishing to play chess while betting cryptocurrency on the outcome.”*

### What is the Purpose of Another Chess Platform? Aren't There Already Sites like Lichess.com and Chess.com?

ChessFish stands apart. It's a platform where users can compete in chess for money, but in a completely trustless manner. 

It's only at the highest levels that chess players get the opportunity to play for money in tournaments.

Top chess organizations, such as FIDE, face issues tied to centralization, including the controversial [banning of players based on their nationality](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-belarus-chess-ban/31756039.html).

In the 1990s, Bobby Fischer was [indicted by the US Government for violating sanctions for participating in a chess tournament](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/12/16/chess-star-indicted-for-ignoring-sanctions/ac8a6d33-98db-4851-8395-5eb440f13f5b/) in Montenegro and Belgrade. 

Since when did chess transform into a political game? 

No country or chess organization should have the power to bar a player from entering a tournament for political, cultural, or racial reasons.

That's the raison d'être for ChessFish. ChessFish empowers players to enjoy chess in a trustless environment, free from the complications of centralization.
