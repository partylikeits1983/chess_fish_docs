# Purpose of ChessFish

### From the ChessFish Whitepaper:

*“The purpose of ChessFish is to serve as a neutral intermediary between two or more parties wishing to play chess while betting cryptocurrency on the outcome.”*[^1]

### ChessFish: An Innovative Chess Platform

#### Why ChessFish When There Are Sites like Lichess.com and Chess.com?

ChessFish stands apart. It's a platform where users can compete in chess for money, but in a completely trustless manner.[^2] It's only at the highest levels that chess players get the opportunity to play for money in tournaments.

#### Problems of Traditional Chess Platforms and Chess Associations

- **Withheld Payments**: Instances like grandmasters being [withheld payment of up to $20k USD](https://en.chessbase.com/post/never-ending-saga-of-moroccan-chess-part-ii) while participating in FIDE sanctioned tournaments highlight the issues of current tournaments.
- **Centralization Issues**: Problems such as the controversial [banning of players based on their nationality](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-belarus-chess-ban/31756039.html) by top chess organizations like FIDE and the [banning of certain national flags on Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/chess-com-stop-the-ban-on-russias-flag).
- **Political Interference**: Historical examples like Bobby Fischer being [indicted for participating in a tournament](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/12/16/chess-star-indicted-for-ignoring-sanctions/ac8a6d33-98db-4851-8395-5eb440f13f5b/) in violation of sanctions.

#### ChessFish's Mission

- **Beyond Politics**: ChessFish aims to transcend chess from being a political game. It advocates for the right of every player to participate in tournaments without facing barriers for political, cultural, or racial reasons.
- **Trustless Environment**: ChessFish is dedicated to empowering players to enjoy chess in a trustless environment, free from the complications of centralization.
