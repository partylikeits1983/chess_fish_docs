#### 4. Enter the number of players
> Note: The number of players determines how many games will the tournament contain.
> Since tournaments on ChessFish are Round Robin tournaments, the number of games in each tournament is dictated by the formula:
> g = (n - 1) * n / 2, where g is number of games, n is number of players.

#### 5. Enter the number of individual games per player and time for the tournament
> If selecting more than 1 game per player, the formula for the number of games played in the tournament is the following:
> g = (n - 1) * n * x / 2, where g is number of games, n is number of players, and x is the number of games per player.
