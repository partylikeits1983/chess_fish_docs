#### Making Moves on the Chess Board
To play moves on the chess board, follow these steps:
1. **Share Public Encryption Key:** Used to encrypt delegated game wallets.
2. **Sign 'wagerAddress' String:** Used as a seed for generating a game public private key pair.
3. **Sign Wallet Delegation Data Type:** This step ensures your wallet delegated signing authority to the generated wallet.

This process allows for a seamless gameplay experience, eliminating the need for constant Metamask pop-ups for each move.

**Submitting Moves:**
- To write the signed moves directly to the smart contract, use the "Submit Moves" button.
- After each game, one of the players must submit the moves on-chain to ensure fair gameplay.
- Note: In future versions of ChessFish, it may be possible to submit games after the completion of the entire wager.

#### Writing Moves Directly to the Smart Contract
If you prefer not to store signed moves off-chain and wish to write moves directly to the smart contract:
- Disable the "Gasless Game" option in the UI.

>Note: The process of playing a move is handled by the "playMove" function in the Chess.fish wager contract. Squares are encoded as uint8 integers and a move is encoded as a uint16 integer, where the first 8 bits are the square from, and the last 8 bits are the square to.
