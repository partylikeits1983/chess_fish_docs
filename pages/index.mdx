## Chess.fish


The Chess.fish protocol is a decentralized system designed for creating chess wagers on the blockchain. 

The protocol is built using smart contracts that are immutable, ensuring censorship resistance, which also eliminates the need for intermediaries who could potentially limit access to the platform.

By using smart contracts, Chess.fish acts as a trusted 3rd party that autonomously enforces the wager conditions agreed upon by players.

Currently, Chess.fish is in alpha (early access) and is currently under developement.
