# About

Chess.fish is a way to play chess on the blockchain for crypto.

Chess.fish is a smart contract based project allows chess enthusiasts to challenge other players to wager any amount of ERC20 tokens. By using smart contracts, Chess.fish can act as a trusted 3rd party that autonomously enforces the wager conditions agreed upon by both players.

Chess.fish was created in May 2023 by partylikeits1983.
